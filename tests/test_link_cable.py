  transmitted. This needs the real BIOS (COMINIT lives in it) and the compiled
  probe ROM, so it SKIPS when either is absent.

The probe ROM (tests/roms/link_probe.ngc, source link_probe_main.c) sends its raw

last byte it received plus a running total, at these globals (from its .map):

#
# `Machine::serial_byte_cycles()` computes one byte-time from SC0MOD and BR0CR
# instead of returning the old constant (TMP95C061 datasheet 3.11; the derivation is
# written above `kSerialByteCycles` in machine.hpp, and in specs/LINK_CABLE.md 2.2).
# A condemning test would show BR0CR = 0x15 pacing four times slower than 0x05.
# Three environments were tried and none can time it:
#
#   * host-driven transmit -- `machine.write(0x50, ...)` does NOT arm a send; it
#     bypasses io_action_write. Only a real ROM can transmit.
#   * receive pacing on a synthetic cartridge -- with 0xFF filler the CPU decodes
#     junk that READS SC0BUF (eating the queued byte) and then wedges; with NOP
#     filler it wedges anyway after ~280 cycles, which is less than ONE byte-time.
#     No cycles run, so serial_tick is never called.
#   * receive pacing on the real BIOS + probe ROM -- works, but the probe ROM drives
#     the link itself and consumes the queued bytes, so the gaps are contaminated and
#     the slow (0x15) case starves before a second byte is presented.
#
# What IS verified: the arithmetic yields exactly 3200 for SC0MOD=0x69 / BR0CR=0x05
# (the values the BIOS writes for every cartridge, measured on ten), and the whole
# link sweep is byte-for-byte identical before and after the change. A real test
# wants a purpose-built probe ROM that programs BR0CR and reports its own timing --
# the same ROM that would finally validate the constant on silicon.
