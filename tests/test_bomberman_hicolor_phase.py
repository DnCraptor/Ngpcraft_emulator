"""BOMBERMAN's HiColor title screen: the 19 raster blocks must stay IN PHASE.

Thor's BOMBERMAN (2004) shows a 146-colour picture on a 16-colour machine by rewriting
20 characters and both scroll palettes every 8 scanlines, double-buffered: while a band
displays bank A, the copier fills bank B for the band after it. `hc_showHW` syncs ONCE
on line 0 and then runs 19 blocks of 224 `ldirw` words WITHOUT polling again, so every
block must cost exactly one 8-line slice (8 x 515 = 4120 cycles).

⚖️ WHY THIS IS A BETTER INSTRUMENT THAN A FRAME-RATE AVERAGE. A per-block error does not
average out, it ACCUMULATES against a starting margin of 73 cycles: 34 cycles too fast
per block and by the fourth block the copy has walked back into the LAST line of the band
still displaying the bank it is overwriting. That is a hard, legible failure -- one
corrupted line per band -- with no tolerance to argue about.

⛔ AND IT WAS BROKEN TWICE, THE SAME WAY: a timing change shipped without re-running it.
2026-08-06 `ldirw_cost` (billed per byte instead of per iteration); 2026-08-2x the silicon
recalibration, which let the bus interface unit prefetch through a block copy and handed
back 48 cycles a block. Hence this test: the ROM is not in the repository, so the check
skips where it is absent -- but where it is present nothing can move that phase silently.

⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS THE PHASE, NOT A PIXEL HASH. It says what the hardware requires --
every copy starts in the FIRST line of a band -- so a failure names the fault instead of
reporting that some picture changed.
