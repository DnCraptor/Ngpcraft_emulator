"""A repeating block transfer leaves the instruction QUEUE EMPTY, and a game proves it.

The TLCS-900's bus interface unit runs ahead of the execution unit, so an instruction's
fetch usually overlaps the one before it (`fetch_pipelined`, `biu_slack` = one 4-byte
queue). A REPEATING block copy is the exception: LDIR/LDIRW own the bus for their whole
run -- a read and a write every iteration -- so nothing can be prefetched behind them,
and the instruction after one pays its fetch in full.

⛔ WITHOUT THIS, THE MODEL HANDED OUT A FREE QUEUE PER BLOCK COPY, and BOMBERMAN (Thor,
2004) convicted it. Its HiColor title screen syncs ONCE on line 0 and then runs 19 blocks
of 224 `ldirw` words open-loop, so each block must cost exactly one 8-scanline slice
(8 x 515 = 4120 cycles) or the picture shears. Measured on the player's own save state:

    without the drain   4086 cycles/block (0.9917x)   -- 34 cycles too FAST, every block
    with it             4134 cycles/block (1.0034x)   -- the closest ever measured

The 34 cycles ACCUMULATE: the copy starts 34 cycles earlier each block against a starting
margin of 73, so from the fourth block on it writes into the LAST line of the band still
displaying the bank it is overwriting. One corrupted line per band, 15 bands -- which is
what the player reported, and what `test_bomberman_hicolor_bands_stay_in_phase` pins.
