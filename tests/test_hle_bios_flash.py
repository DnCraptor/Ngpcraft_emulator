"""THE SAVE, WITHOUT bios.bin — the clean-room BIOS image's flash driver.

A Neo Geo Pocket has no save RAM: a game saves by asking the BIOS to ERASE a block of
its own cartridge and PROGRAM its slot back in. The HLE image used to leave those four
vectors on the default `ret` stub, which left RA3 holding the CARD NUMBER the caller
passed (0) — read back as SYS_SUCCESS. **Every save reported success and wrote
nothing.** These tests exist so that cannot come back quietly.

They need no Toshiba toolchain: they run the committed hle_bios/bios_hle.bin through
the native core, exactly as the emulator does when no real BIOS is present.

⚠️ EVERY SAVE TEST HERE WRITES OVER SOMETHING. A virgin chip is all 0xFF, so a program
needs no erase and a driver that only half works still appears to save. The slot is
poisoned first, on purpose.
