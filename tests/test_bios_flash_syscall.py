"""THE IN-GAME SAVE, through the door a real game actually uses.

A Neo Geo Pocket game does not drive the flash chip. It calls the BIOS:

    ld rw3, VECT_FLASHERS    ; 8    -- erase the block
    ld ra3, 0                ;         card 0 (0x200000)
    ld rb3, BLOCK_NB
    swi 1

    ld rw3, VECT_FLASHWRITE  ; 6    -- write the data
    ld ra3, 0
    ld rbc3, 1               ;         1 unit = 256 bytes
    ld xhl3, source
    ld xde3, offset_in_cart
    swi 1

(SNK SysCall.txt; the vector numbers are SNK's own SYSTEM.INC, and this is verbatim
what 02_CODE_PATTERNS/.../rom/flash.c does. Note the SDK's ngpc.h in this RAG has
`#define VECT_FLASHWRITE` with NO VALUE -- trusting it would have called vector 0,
which is SHUTDOWN.)

So `swi 1` runs the REAL BIOS routine, which issues the real AMD command cycles at
the real flash chip. This test asserts the WHOLE chain, and it is the only test here
that can: an emulator can have a flawless flash chip and still lose every save,
which is precisely what this one did.

⚠️ IT FAILED FOR A REASON WORTH REMEMBERING. The BIOS reads a byte of its own work
RAM (0x6C58) that records which cartridge it found at power-on, and returns error
0xFF without touching the chip if it is zero. Our hand-off skips the BIOS boot, so
that byte was never written. Every layer below was correct and the save still went
nowhere -- the failure was in a byte nobody had thought to hand over.
