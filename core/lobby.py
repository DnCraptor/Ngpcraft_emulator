"""Client for the NgpCraft link lobby + relay server (server/lobby_server.py).

`LobbyClient` owns a background socket thread and speaks the length-prefixed

updates via signals; serial bytes are exchanged through thread-safe buffers that
`LobbyLink.pump()` moves in and out of the emulated console each frame.

Wire protocol (mirrors the server): header = 1 byte TYPE + 4 bytes big-endian
LENGTH, then payload. TYPE 1 = JSON control, TYPE 2 = serial relay bytes.
